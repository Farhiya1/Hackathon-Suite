Button (join a project)
The btn will hold the following info - Max developers for the project
if it's the  1st usert
when the user clicks the Button
a team name is randomly generated
the user_id from sessions is sent in a object

Back-end

the 1st user is a post - creates team and team name
2nd user on it's an update - simply adds more users 


Find a way to keep track of how many users join a project
 option 1 - whenever you create a team, you include the model project and find syntact to remove one developers
  
  Everytime the same project (which you will have to access by id) receives another user, it deletes a developer
